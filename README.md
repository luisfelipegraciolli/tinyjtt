## tinyjtt CLI: Installation and Uninstallation Guide

This guide will help you install and uninstall the tinyjtt command-line tool on your system.
## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to install tinyjtt on your terminal:

1) Extract the Package:
First, decompress the .tar.gz file you've downloaded from the Release Page. Navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the command:
```Bash
tar -xvf tinyjtt.tar.gz
```
This will create a new directory (likely named tinyjtt or similar) containing the installation files.

2) Access the Directory and Grant Permissions:
Enter the newly extracted directory and grant execute permissions to the installation script:
```Bash
cd tinyjtt_extracted_directory # Replace 'tinyjtt_extracted_directory' with the actual directory name
chmod +x install.sh
```
3) Run the Installation Script:
Now, execute the installation script. It will take care of setting everything up for you:
```Bash
./install.sh
```
Verify the Installation:
After running the script, you can verify if tinyjtt was installed correctly by typing the command in your terminal:
```Bash
    tinyjtt help
```
If the installation was successful, you should see the help message or usage options for your tinyjtt tool.

üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

If you need to remove tinyjtt from your system, follow these steps:
 
1) Access the Installation Directory:
Navigate to the directory where you originally extracted and installed tinyjtt (the same directory where uninstall.sh is located):
```Bash
cd tinyjtt_extracted_directory # Again, replace with the actual directory name
```

2) Grant Permissions and Run the Uninstallation Script:
Grant execute permissions to the uninstallation script and run it:
```Bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

This script will remove all tinyjtt files and configurations from your system.
